# OpenNMS Integration API (OIA)

## Goal 

Understand how to use the OIA and how write a plugin.

## Philosophy

We want to have a stable, semantically versioned api, against which plugins and extensions should be written.
It is expected that major versions of the integration api will be supported for multiple major releases of Horizon, requiring no changes to plugin code.
