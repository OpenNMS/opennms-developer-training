## Goal

Understand how flows work in OpenNMS

1. Sentinel
1. Adapter
1. Proto on Kafka
1. Nephron
1. Elasticsearch

## Lab

TODO: Synthetic Flows
* Generate some known flow pattern using Riptide
* git clone https://github.com/opennms-forge/opennms-riptide

TODO: Should be a wget of a jar

TODO: Also push time series via Graphite

TODO: Be able to do this over the opennms-demo environment
