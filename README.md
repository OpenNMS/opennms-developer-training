# OpenNMS Developer Training

These guides were built to give you the knowledge you need to set up a development environment and start developing new features with OpenNMSâ€™ APIs.

## Work in progress

This documentation is actively being worked on.
It is intended to be used as support material for instructor led training sessions.

## Target Audience
